# Full-Magic-Pack
Pack containing nearly all public Magic templates for MSE, except outdated ones. You can submit things we're missing via Pull Request or linking a source in Issues.

# Installation
1. Download [this zip file](https://github.com/MagicSetEditorPacks/Full-Magic-Pack/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).
2. Extract the zip file. It will contain 5 items:
    * a subfolder `data`, which is where the templates are installed.
    * a subfolder `Magic - Fonts`, which contains necessary font files.
    * `magicseteditor.exe` and `mse.exe`, the regular version of the app. The files are identical.
    * `magicseteditor.com`, a command-line version of MSE for advanced users.
    * `Template Creation Tutorial.odt`, a guide on how to make your own templates.
3. If you already had a previous version of MSE, move or copy all other subfolders into your existing MSE folder. Otherwise, this folder acts as a stand alone installation.

# Change Language
1. Launch MSE.
2. Select your desired language at the bottom right of the welcome window.
3. Whenever you create a new Set, go to Set info tab > Defaults and Automation section > Card language > select your desired language.
