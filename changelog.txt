MSE Template Packs 3.1.0 Mainframe Battles (PRERELEASE)

__Mainframe Battles (Single-face)__
• Added the Mainframe Battles template, for single face battles.
• In addition to the standard layout from March of the Machine, I have added a "Boxed" style, which has a frame border and boxed in art like a normal card, a "Spillover" style which is that but has the art continue over the frame to the border, and a "Borderless" style which covers the entire card save the copyright area.
• The Defense symbol is not baked into the frame, and can be changed to a loyalty symbol or a PT box from the Style tab
• You can add a Lesson/Transform node by clicking to the left of the name. You can have this switch to the opposite side with an option in the Style tab.
• There is also a Style option to add a Transform arrow and ghost PT, as a temporary measure until we get Battles into Mainframe DFC.
• The template supports the Universes Beyond texture and stamps
• The template supports Nyx, Snow, Vehicle, and Custom border on the Boxed and Spillover styles.

__MSE 2.5.8__
GenevensiS and TomTkacz have been in the C++ mines making MSE sing like she hasn't in a while.
• Fonts are now automatically loaded from the Magic - Fonts folder and subfolders and don't need to be installed manually.
• Fixed a silent freeze that could occur if you opened a file and were missing templates for it.
• Dropdown menus will no longer be closed when a console message appears.
• Fixed handling of the word "Plains" in the scripts `english_singular` and `english_plural`.
• Added a field type "slider", which provides a slider UI for options that are exclusively numbers.
• Added `import_image` and `get_mse_path` scripts to allow MSE to load external images. In a later update we will use these to avoid needing to reload when changing magic-mainframe-extras files.
• Image fields using a default image will no longer override it with a checkerboard pattern.
• Added `include localized file` token, providing support for loading localized files for more seamless localization usage.
• Added basic CSV / TSV / JSON importers, available from the Cards menu. Scryfall JSON files are supported. In a later update, fully customizable user written importers will be available.
• Added `alt name` field property. The importers will look for these names when parsing, to know which field to populate.
• Added `import script` field property. This script will be applied to the value found in the imported file, when creating the cards with the `new_card` function.
• Added `import script` game property. This script is run as the final step of the `new_card` function, to do some global cleanup.
• Added `stylesheet`, `styling_data` and `notes` keys to the `new_card` function, so that these values can be populated.
• Added `add_card_to_set` script function, to add a card to a set (for use in the CLI).
• Added `make_map` script function, which takes a list of keys and a list of values, and produces a map. This allows for dynamical map initialization.
• Added `resize_image` script function, to change an image's size.
• Added `insert_image` script function, to embed an image inside another.
• Added `add_bleed_edge` script function, to add a crude print bleed edge to an image.
• Added `folder name` package property.
• Added `silver` and `gold` color words, representing rgb(200,200,200) and rgb(200,180,0) respectively.
• Added selected card count, filtered card count and total card count info to toolbar.
• Made a few values scriptable (border color radius/left width/right width/top width/bottom width, and font shadow displacement x/displacement y/blur)
• Rewrote print layout logic so it accommodates for DFCs and different sized cards.
• Fixed "referencing nonexistant file" error that could show up when undoing an image change or deletion

__More New Templates__
Thanks to GenevensiS for their continued work on keeping up with the Showcases!
• Add the Aetherdrift First Place, First Place Planeswalker, and First Place Full Art land frames. Without access to the Space Cadet font, we don't plan to make the Rude Riders variant.
• Added the Tarkir Draconic, Draconic Adventure, Ghostfire, and Ghostfire Planeswalker frames
• Added the Secret Lair Arcade frame
• Added the MKM Magnified Showcase frame
• Added the UNF, ONE, LCI Full Art land frames. Those and NEO have code to detect or manually select up to two basic types.
• Added the Mechanic Reminder frame, for things like Start your engines!
• Added Grapple's Old Sagas frame
• Added DoX's Sokrates frame

__Other Updates__
• Updated types and keywords to Final Fantasy
• Added word_lists_linux as a workaround for Linux users having issues with generated word_lists.
• Added a Style option to change Casting Cost Mana Symbols to Mainframe, Adventures, Battles, Planeswalkers, and Sagas.
• Added custom fonts module to Full Art Basic Lands.
• Added popunder support to M15 Mainframe.
• Added old tap symbol support to GenevensiS frames.

__Template Code Updates__
• color_background() now accepts three new parameters, artifact_blend, hybrid_blend, and multicolor_blend, which default to "mask", which behaves the same as before. Setting these to "black" will have them blend as only their respective base frame; artifact, colorless, or multicolor; without the color gradient. Setting these as "white" does the reverse, using the gradient alone and not the base cards. This allows you to skip having a dozen solid black/white images for blending, which we are rolling out to old frames as needed.
• Added "isfront" and "isback" support to face code.

__Bug Fixes__
• Fixed a bug where UB Sagas were too dark.
• Fixed a bug where hybrid Adventure pages were blending incorrectly.
• Fixed a bug where the Set tab Inverted Common Symbol wasn't working on most frames.
• Fixed some bugs with automated custom border with multicolor and overlapping effects.
• Fixed a bug in Full Art Lands w/Basic Land Symbol where the textbox effect wasn't displaying.
• Fixed a bug rounding negative numbers.
• Fixed a bug in the French localization where the type after Enchant was being incorrectly capitalized.
• Fixed issues with special_text not having access to certain card fields.
