MSE Template Packs 1.3.0 Showcase Catchup (PRERELEASE)

SHOWCASE FRAMES

MAGIC MODULES
• Genevensis has figured out a powerful tool for template building, which has been added to the pack as magic-modules.mse-include
• magic-modules will allow any template to very easily gain access to complicated field behavior, such as...

MAGIC MODULE ROLLOUT
• [todo applicable frames]
• Frames can now use Standard, Acorn, Universes Beyond, Heart, and Alchemy stamps!
• Frames can add styling options to change their casting cost mana symbols, apply custom fonts, or use the rarity recolor and offset options.
• Frames can use Genevensis's Corners tech for square, diagonal, aliased, or pixel curve corners.
• Frames can use the expanded credit suite, which allows up to 4 spots around the art credit to add additional symbols for Mechanics, Flavor Text, Frame, etc.
• Frames can use the updated OCR fields, which have UB Copyright and the new card numbering code (see Parititons below).
• Frames can use the loyalty module to painlessly make Planeswalker versions of frames.
• Frames can use the symbols module to include transform symbols, which now lets you to select Modal DFC icons.
• The watermarks module now simplifies watermarks to one script instead of three include files.

ADVENTURE OVERHAUL
• Adventures can now customize both halves of the textbox, allowing for two pages.
• Added support for flat pages and pages with only a nameline and no typeline.
• Added "page decorations," images that layer over pages that can be added to magic-mainframe-extras.

PARTITIONS
• Cards can now be put into partitions 0-9 and A-Z, which will change how the automatic sorter sorts them. This allows MSE to handle things like overcounted cards, and face commanders being listed before everything else.
• Cards are in Partition A by default. Paritions 0-9 sort before this, Partitions B-Z sort after it. Cards within the same partition sort under the normal logic.
• Partitions N-Z by default are "over-partition", and their cards won't be counted in the set's total. There is a set option for displaying these cards in the "301/300" or "301" format. There is also a set option for changing the "last main partition" that does not have this effect, default "M".
• Currently this is supported on M15 Mainframe and Adventures. Other frames can now add the card field "parition select" to access a card's partition.
• Normally this is put over the automated card number. You can click there to select a new parition for a card.
• Additionally, there is a set option for defining the card number style, "0001", "0001/0099", "001", "001/099", "1", and "1/99"

OTHER UPDATES
• MSE has been updated to MSE 2.1.3! This fixes a bug where single line text-fields like names and typelines couldn't be automatically shrunk, and adds shift-click to select multiple options in the export window. This isn't the full jump to hagan's 2.4.0 fork yet, but we're getting there.
• Added Custom Border to M15 Mainframe and Adventure, which allows defining a trim frame like Vehicle or Nyx with images from magic-mainframe-extras
• Keywords and types for MKM, PIP, OTJ, and MH3 have been added.
• Added Capenna, DND, Desparked, Judge Academy, MLP, Shooting Star, Transformers, and hi-res mana symbol watermarks.
• Added support for Custom Watermarks up to a maximum size of 1024x1024. Watermarks that aren't 500x500 will still need to include their height and width.
• Split the "blend with colors" watermark option into one that applies to custom watermarks and one that applies to default watermarks.
• Reorganized the Set tab into something hopefully easier to navigate.
• Added the up and down triangles as mainframe transform options.
• Added support for dungeons with 8 levels.
• Added option to remove backface rarity symbol to Mainframe DFC.
• Added option to remove the colored name banner from Unstable Basics.
• Added omni and polyamory flags to Pride Pinlines.

BUG FIXES
• Fixed a bug where the 8th Edition Tokens name spacing would go beserk.
• Fixed a bug that was eating spaces in the typeline.
• Fixed some cases where +1/+1 was getting converted to loyalty symbols.
• Fixed many template warnings across the template packs.
• Fixed a bug with custom italic font.
• Fixed a bug with token custom font using the wrong fonts.

TEMPLATE CLEANUP
• magic-mainframe-extras examples have been cleaned up and moved into one folder. The repo now has a .gitignore for this so it's easier to run MSE off the repo.
• Take the Crown Draft Matters frame now includes the Conspiracy frame.
• M15 Leveler now has TriLeveler support.
• The following frames have been removed from the Full Pack. There is an Outdated Templates pack available as a backup, but these templates are now redundant and are no longer being supported.
• Redudant with M15 Mainframe: M15 Clear, M15 Custom, M15 Metropolis, Mined & Mined Planeshifted, M15 Miracle, M15 Nyx, M15 Planeshifted & Planeshifted Leveler, M15 Vehicles, Vehicles
• Redundant with Mainframe Tokens: M15 Tokens
• Redundant with CN2 Styles and M15 Mainframe: TTK Conspiracy
