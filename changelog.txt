MSE Template Packs 3.0.0 Showcase Catchup (PRERELEASE)

HOUSEKEEPING
• Custom Watermarks will need to be moved to magic-mainframe-extras from magic-watermarks!
• I have created a tool at https://mse-editor.neocities.org/ which you can upload MSE files to in order to patch their data. Not all sets will need this, but it will stop your console from blowing up with harmless warnings the first time you load sets

MSE 2.5
Genevensis and Hagan have been doing excellent work at getting MSE compiled and edited lately, and so this update also has us upgrading from MSE 2.1.2 all the way to MSE 2.5.4! What does that mean for you?
UI Updates:
• When selecting Games or Templates, there is now a search bar that allows you to filter templates.
• Added the ability to underline text via Ctrl+U or the [u]U[/u] buttom on the top panel.
• The template canvas now takes DPI into account, so high res templates will no longer be massively larger than other templates. They will still export at full size.
• Symbol files will no longer complain about dependencies.
Image Updates:
• The Image Importer now has buttons to vertically and/or horizontally center input art.
• In Edit -> Preferences -> Internal, you can now set a scale at which new images are imported into MSE. This lets you save images at double size, so they don't turn into pixely messes when you zoom out. In this same tab there is also an option to store images with their file extension, to make external editing of MSE files easier.
• The Export and View zooms are now seperate options.
• MSE can now find ".jpeg" and ".tiff" images.
Template Development Updates:
• Extra card data is now available for template development under `extra_card.field_name` and `extra_card_style.field_name.style_name`!
• The built-in functions `width_of(image)` and `height_of(image)` have been added.
• The built-in function `exists_in_package("/package-name.package-extension/file-name.file-extension")` has been added to check if a file exists.
• Stylesheets can now define `card regions`, with properties `name:, x:, y:, width:, height:`. These can be accessed in the array stylesheet.card_regions to help the script decide how to split images with multiple regions.
• The "info" field type is now supported in the style tab.
• Setting an "image" field as "editable: false" will remove the "double click to load" text as well as the checkerboard pattern. To link an image with it, use the "default" property.
• The built-in function `to_date` now accepts "now" as a parameter.
• Added combine modes "greater than N" and "smaller than N", where N is multiples of 5 between 0 and 255. These apply to pixels which have all their RGB values greater/smaller than N. The main use case for this is applying textures to text; An example texture `set_combine("texture.png", combine:"greater than 160")` layered over text will be masked to only appear over white and light gray pixels. This works best when the text is on a high contrast background, otherwise the texture may be applied to the background.
• Right margin now works, with the same 10x divisor than left margin has.
• The `linear_blend` and `masked_blend` functions now also blend alpha channels
Export templates
• Fixed a bug where Export Templates with many options didn't have a scrollbar.
• Multi-selecting cards in the Export list now lets you check/uncheck all selected cards.
• Export templates can now write to subdirectories.
• The built-in function `get_card_styling(card)` has been added, which returns the card.styling object which was not properly accessible in export templates.
• The built-in function `to_card_image(card[, zoom:100, angle:0])` has been added, so Export templates can now edit card images, to do things like split DFC images.
Bug Fixes:
• Fixed a bug where some Unicode, such as Kanji and Cryllic characters, were unable to be typed.
• Fixed a bug where the Add Multiple Cards scripts didn't load until you switched to another tab first.
• Fixed a bug where long typelines would get squished during printing.
• Fixed several bugs that caused typing in the name and type to lag on larger set files.

MAGIC MODULES
Genevensis has figured out a powerful tool for template building: magic-modules.mse-include. magic-modules will allow frames to access complicated field definitions, which can be updated across all frames at once. Some exciting things magic-modules has allowed us to add already:
• M15 frames can now use Standard, Acorn, Universes Beyond, Heart, Alchemy, and even Custom stamps! Set fields have been added to define a set's default stamp shape, and the stamping logic (such as Universes Beyond having all cards stamped, but using a non-holo stamp for non rare cards). This also lets you disable stamps, so the "use holofoil stamps" option has been removed from nearly all templates. Some templates will also have a copy of these options in their Styling options, so you can have a normally stamped set that uses Universes Beyond stamping only on the PipBoy Frame, for example.
• M15 frames can use the expanded credit suite, which allows up to 4 spots around the art credit to add additional symbols for Mechanics, Flavor Text, Frame, and additional Artists.
• M15 frames now use the updated OCR fields, which have UB Copyright, The List icon, and the new card numbering code (see Parititons below).
• All frames can also add the Alchemy name symbols, which also appear in the CARDNAME atom!
• All frames can now use Genevensis's Corners tech for square, diagonal, aliased, or pixel curve corners.
• Frames can now easily add styling options to change their casting cost mana symbols, apply custom fonts, or use the rarity recolor and offset options.
• Frames can use the loyalty module to painlessly make Planeswalker versions of frames.
• Frames can use the symbols module to include transform symbols, which now lets you to select Modal DFC icons.
• The watermarks module now simplifies watermarks to one script instead of three include files. REMINDER: If you have custom watermarks, you will now need to move these to the magic-mainframe-extras folder rather than magic-watermarks!
• You can run your set on the neocities tool to clean up warnings due to code changes: Most of them are completely harmless and will stop showing up once you save. The main data that could be lost is Lesson/Transform symbols on M15 Mainframe and Mainframe DFC.

PARTITIONS
Card number partitioning is a script I've been kicking around for months, and we've finally got all the knots sorted out!
• Cards can now be put into partitions 0-9 and A-Z, which will change how the automatic sorter sorts them. This allows MSE to handle things like overcounted cards, and face commanders being listed before everything else.
• Cards are in Partition A by default. Paritions 0-9 sort before these cards, Partitions B-Z sort after them. Cards within the same partition sort under the normal logic (color then alphabetical).
• Partitions N-Z by default are "over-partition", and their cards won't be counted in the set's total. There is a set option for displaying these cards in the "301/300" or "301" format. There is also a set option for changing the "last main partition" that does not have this effect, default "M".
• Currently this is supported on M15 Mainframe and Adventures. Other frames can now add the card field "parition select" to access a card's partition.
• Normally the selector for this is put over the automated card number. You can click there to select a new parition for a card.
• Additionally, there is a set option for defining the card number style, "0001", "0001/0099", "001", "001/099", "1", and "1/99"

ADVENTURE OVERHAUL
• Adventures can now customize both halves of the textbox, allowing for two pages.
• Added support for flat pages and pages with only a nameline and no typeline.
• Added "page decorations," images that layer over pages that can be added to magic-mainframe-extras.

MAINFRAME SUITE UPDATES
• Mainframe templates now have "Custom Border", which allows you to use a trim frame akin to Vehicle or Nyx with images from magic-mainframe-extras. This can be either a single image, which will use the form "image.png", or use color blending, which will take the form "-color-image.png" and use images wimage.png, uimage.png, etc.
• Mainframe templates now automatically apply the Nyx frame to enchantments. This is controlled by the new Set option "auto nyx".
• Mainframe templates can now provide an alternate image source to use for Nyx via the "alternate nyx" Set option. This can be from magic-mainframe-extras (with "folder/image.png" using "folder/wimage.png", "folder/uimage.png" etc), or use "star", a built in alternate from TVP's Altered Plus. More built-in will likely be added in future.
• M15 Mainframe, M15 Adventures, and M15 Sagas now support Universes Beyond, which default to automated on cards with triangle stamps.
• M15 Sagas and Mainframe DFC now support Cases.
• M15 Sagas and Mainframe DFC now allow for customization of Class Level Bars, adding bars without arrows, the Case line, and the ability to provide a custom image from magic-mainframe-extras.
• Mainframe DFC now supports planeswalkers with 5 and 6 abilities.
• Mainframe DFC now has an option to remove the backface rarity.
• Mainframe DFC now has "front chop" and "back chop" options that work like the other frame's chops. Level chops remain as a fallback (so you don't need to update anything), but are now moved to the Leveler/Saga editing section.
• Mainframe DFC's Saga and Clear frames now have proper circles around their transform icon.
• "Snap chapter to box" options now update automatically, without needing a closing comma.
• M15 Mainframe's Lesson frame is now accessed by clicking the big square to the left of the name, with the empty tombstone/alchemy box moving further left. Note you will need to re-assign Lesson symbols, either with the neocities patcher or doing it by hand.
• M15 Mainframe now has Miracle support for Legendary, FNM, Inverted, Conspiracy, and Universes Beyond frames.
• M15 Mainframe now has an option to prevent trim frames like Snow and Nyx from covering the Devoid texture.
• Mainframe Planeswalkers now has a setting to change its popout art to "popunder" art, which layers underneath the text, casting cost, and rarity symbol, but over the other frame elements.
• Mainframe Planes has been updated to the version of the frame from MOM. The old frame is retained behind a style option. The code has been updated so the two textboxes are connected, and it now automates the divider.

OTHER UPDATES
• The Set tab has been reorganized into something hopefully easier to navigate.
• "Alias as CARDNAME" has been replaced with "CARDNAME replacement", which will let you choose between CARDNAME taking the card's name, the card's alias, or the card's types (as seen in Foundations cards).
• Keywords and types have been updated through Duskmourn.
• Added the keyword utility handle_action_rt(to:"name", "Action"). This can be used to add "To {name}," before the reminder text when it isn't right next to the keyword, such as handle_action_rt(to:"forage", "Exile"). capitalization matters here.
• Added the keyword utility handle_merged_rt("Normal", moved:"Alternate"). This can be used to add clarifying text when reminder text is merged, like in [card]Cache Grab[/card]. Unlike the previous, this only changes during reminder text merges, not any distance from the keyword.
• Bloomburrow's Pawprint symbol has been added as [J].
• Added Capenna, DND, Desparked, Judge Academy, MLP, Shooting Star, Transformers, and hi-res mana symbol watermarks.
• Custom Watermarks can now have a maximum size of 1024x1024, and no longer need to define their height and width.
• The "blend with colors" watermark option has been split into one that applies to custom watermarks and one that applies to default watermarks.
• Transform icons now include and default to the Up and Down triangles. Modal DFC icons are now selectable, and on DFCs will attempt to make the card a modal DFC when you do so.
• Added an option to Unstable Basics to remove the colored name banner.
• Added eighth level support to M15 Dungeons.
• Added omni and polyamory flags to Pride Pinlines.
• The name checker exporter has been updated, and now does more filtering for Near Name Matches (for example, Dreameater will now be caught due to Dream Eater).

BUG FIXES
• Fixed a bug where the 8th Edition Tokens name spacing would go beserk.
• Fixed a bug that was eating spaces in the typeline.
• Fixed some cases where +1/+1 was getting converted to loyalty symbols.
• Fixed many template warnings across the template packs.
• Fixed a bug with custom italic font.
• Fixed a bug with token custom font using the wrong fonts.

TEMPLATE CLEANUP
• magic-mainframe-extras examples have been cleaned up and moved into one folder. The repo now has a .gitignore for this so it's easier to run MSE off the repo.
• Take the Crown Draft Matters frame now includes the Conspiracy frame.
• M15 Leveler now has TriLeveler support.
• The following frames have been removed from the Full Pack. There is an Outdated Templates pack available as a backup, but these templates are now redundant and are no longer being supported.
• Redudant with M15 Mainframe: M15 Clear, M15 Custom, M15 Metropolis, Mined & Mined Planeshifted, M15 Miracle, M15 Nyx, M15 Planeshifted & Planeshifted Leveler, M15 Vehicles, Vehicles
• Redundant with Mainframe Tokens: M15 Tokens
• Redundant with CN2 Styles and M15 Mainframe: TTK Conspiracy
• Again, there is a tool at https://mse-editor.neocities.org/ to help convert these frames to their current ones.
