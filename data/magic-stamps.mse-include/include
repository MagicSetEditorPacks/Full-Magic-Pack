# This file doesn't do anything.
# Other files in this directory can be included in game/style files.
# To use it in a template, add the following line, not indented, in the card style section:
# include file: /magic-stamps.mse-include/complete_stamps

# Also add the following in the template headers:
#depends on:
#	package:			magic-stamps.mse-include
#	version:			2024-01-29



# Optionally, you can adjust global alignment by defining the following functions in the init script,
# which must return an int corresponding to the number of pixels you want to shift the stamp by:

# To shift it up/down:
# card_stamp_offset_top := { 0 }

# To shift it left/right:
# card_stamp_offset_left := { 0 }

# To increase/decrease the width:
# card_stamp_offset_width := { 0 }

# To increase/decrease the height:
# card_stamp_offset_height := { 0 }

# For the second face of DFCs use:
# card_stamp_offset_top_2 := { 0 }
# card_stamp_offset_left_2 := { 0 }
# card_stamp_offset_width_2 := { 0 }
# card_stamp_offset_height_2 := { 0 }

# For DFC or TFC templates, dont forget to override the faces_coordinates function.

# You can disable the stamp on the second or third faces,
# by adding the following functions in the init script:
# card_stamp_disabled_2 := { true }
# card_stamp_disabled_3 := { true }
