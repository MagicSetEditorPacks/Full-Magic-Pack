# Full-Magic-Pack
Pack containing nearly all public Magic templates for MSE, except outdated ones. You can submit things we're missing via Pull Request or linking a source in Issues.

# Installation
1. Download [this zip file](https://github.com/MagicSetEditorPacks/Full-Magic-Pack/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).
2. Extract the zip file. It will contain 5 items:
    * a subfolder `data`, which is where the templates are installed.
    * a subfolder `Magic - Fonts`, which contains necessary font files.
    * a subfolder `backup`, which contains the previous stable version of the app.
    * `magicseteditor.exe` and `mse.exe`, the regular version of the app. The files are identical.
    * `magicseteditor.com`, a command-line version of MSE for advanced users.
3. Open the subfolder `Magic - Fonts`. It contains several `.ttf` and/or `.otf` files. Select them all, right-click on one of them, then click Install. Some templates may require additional fonts, provided in the `template specific fonts` subfolder.
4. If you already had a previous version of MSE, move or copy all other subfolders into your existing MSE folder. Otherwise, this folder acts as a stand alone installation.

# Change Language

    MSE Folder/data/magic.mse-game/

5. Locate the "statistics_XX" file of your desired language, and rename it to "statistics" (without any extension).
