Make sure you have updated cockatrice!

To install, simply copy and paste the magic-cockatrice.mse-export-template into the MSE data folder

To export, open MSE and select HTML in the export dropdown

To use standalone, save the export into the Cockatrice folder located in Users (C:\\Users\[ACCOUNT_NAME]\App Data\Local; App Data may be hidden!)
	change the file path to your file under settings in Cockatrice (Cockatrice will need to restart!)
	
To use images, make a new folder in Cockatrice\pics\downloadedPics (name it your set code) and places you card images in it
 
To use with other cards, simply place the new .xml file in the customsets folder (C:\\Users\[ACCOUNT_NAME]\App Data\Local\Cockatrice\Cockatrice\customsets)
then restart cockatrice

To use DFC's export images like normal but then use an image editor to split each card into two images with the appropriate names
