### This file doesn't do anything.
### Other files in this directory can be included in game/style files.
### This include covers the transformation symbols and card type symbols.
### To use it in a template, add the following line, not indented, in the card style section:
# include file: /magic-symbols.mse-include/complete_transforms

### Also add the following in the template headers:
#depends on:
#	package:			magic-symbols.mse-include
#	version:			2024-01-29

### Optionally, you can adjust global alignment by defining the following functions in the init script,
### which must return an int corresponding to the number of pixels you want to shift things by:

### To shift everything up/down:
# transform_symbol_offset_top := { 0 }

### To shift everything left/right:
# transform_symbol_offset_left := { 0 }

### To increase the width or height:
# transform_symbol_offset_width := { 0 }
# transform_symbol_offset_height := { 0 }

### To move the symbol to the right of the card:
# transform_symbol_mirrored := { true }

### For the other faces on DFCs use:
# transform_symbol_offset_top_2 := { 0 }
# transform_symbol_offset_left_2 := { 0 }
# transform_symbol_offset_width_2 := { 0 }
# transform_symbol_offset_height_2 := { 0 }
# transform_symbol_offset_mirrored_2 := { 0 }
# transform_symbol_offset_top_3 := { 0 }
# transform_symbol_offset_left_3 := { 0 }
# transform_symbol_offset_width_3 := { 0 }
# transform_symbol_offset_height_3 := { 0 }
# transform_symbol_offset_mirrored_3 := { 0 }

### For DFC or TFC templates, dont forget to override the faces_coordinates function.

### You can disable the symbols on some of the faces,
### by adding the following functions in the init script:
# transform_symbol_disabled := { true }
# transform_symbol_disabled_2 := { true }
# transform_symbol_disabled_3 := { true }
