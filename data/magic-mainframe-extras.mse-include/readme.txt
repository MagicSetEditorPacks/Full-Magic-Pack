Hello, and welcome to Mainframe Extras. Images added here can be used by Mainframe projects to customize your cards in ways
previously impossible. Try to give your images unique or personalized names, or even create your own folder, to
avoid overwriting others' public images.

To use these images, type name.png or folder/name.png into the custom masks or other fields of the style tab,
and Mainframe will handle the magic-mainframe-extras/ part.

When you release your set, include any custom masks you have made so they can be added to others' folders.

mfsfiles/ contains images that can be shared across most Mainframe templates
