# This file doesn't do anything.
# Other files in this directory can be included in game/style files.
# This include covers the corners of the border.
# To use it in a template, add the following line, not indented, in the card style section:
# include file: /magic-corners.mse-include/complete_corners

# Also add the following in the template headers:
#depends on:
#	package:			magic-corners.mse-include
#	version:			2024-01-29

# For DFC or TFC templates, dont forget to override the faces_coordinates function.

# Optionally, you can disable the corners on the second or third faces,
# by adding the following functions in the init script:
# corners_disabled_2 := { true }
# corners_disabled_3 := { true }
