### This file doesn't do anything.
### Other files in this directory can be included in game/style files.
### This include covers the card number, set code, artist credit and copyright lines.
### To use it in a template, add the following line, not indented, in the card style section:
# include file: /magic-copyright.mse-include/complete_copyright

### Also add the following in the template headers:
#depends on:
#	package:			magic-copyright.mse-include
#	version:			2024-01-29

### Optionally, you can adjust global alignment by defining the following functions in the init script,
### which must return an int corresponding to the number of pixels you want to shift things by:

### To shift everything up/down:
# copyright_offset_top := { 0 }

### To shift the card number, set code and artist credit left/right:
# copyright_offset_left := { 0 }

### To shift the actual copyright lines left/right:
# copyright_offset_right := { 0 }

### To shift the copyright up/down on creatures/walkers, if the pt/loyalty box is very short/tall:
# copyright_offset_pt_top := { 0 }

### To shift the secondary copyright left/right on creatures/walkers, if the pt/loyalty box is very narrow/wide:
# copyright_offset_pt_left := { 0 }

### For the other faces on DFCs use:
# copyright_offset_top_2 := { 0 }
# copyright_offset_left_2 := { 0 }
# copyright_offset_right_2 := { 0 }
# copyright_offset_pt_top_2 := { 0 }
# copyright_offset_pt_left_2 := { 0 }
# copyright_offset_top_3 := { 0 }
# copyright_offset_left_3 := { 0 }
# copyright_offset_right_3 := { 0 }
# copyright_offset_pt_top_3 := { 0 }
# copyright_offset_pt_left_3 := { 0 }

### These work the same on 90° rotated cards, but you need to imagine the card is upright

### For DFC or TFC templates, dont forget to override the faces_coordinates function.

### You can disable the copyright on some of the faces,
### by adding the following functions in the init script:
# copyright_disabled := { true }
# copyright_disabled_2 := { true }
# copyright_disabled_3 := { true }
