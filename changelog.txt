MSE Template Packs 3.1.0 Mainframe Battles (PRERELEASE)

__Mainframe Battles (Single-face)__
• Added the Mainframe Battles template, for single face battles.
• In addition to the standard layout from March of the Machine, I have added a "Boxed" style, which has a frame border and boxed in art like a normal card, a "Spillover" style which is that but has the art continue over the frame to the border, and a "Borderless" style which covers the entire card save the copyright area.
• The Defense symbol is not baked into the frame, and can be changed to a loyalty symbol or a PT box from the Style tab
• You can add a Lesson/Transform node by clicking to the left of the name. You can have this switch to the opposite side with an option in the Style tab.
• There is also a Style option to add a Transform arrow and ghost PT, as a temporary measure until we get Battles into Mainframe DFC.
• The template supports the Universes Beyond texture and stamps
• The template supports Nyx, Snow, Vehicle, and Custom border on the Boxed and Spillover styles.

__More New Templates__
Thanks to GenevensiS for their continued work on keeping up with the Showcases!
• Add the Aetherdrift First Place, First Place Planeswalker, and First Place Full Art land frames. Without access to the Space Cadet font, we don't plan to make the Rude Riders variant.
• Added the MKM Magnified Showcase frame
• Added the ONE and LCI Full Art land frames
• Added the Mechanic Reminder frame, for things like Start your engines!

__Template Code Updates__
• color_background() now accepts three new parameters, artifact_blend, hybrid_blend, and multicolor_blend, which default to "mask", which behaves the same as before. Setting these to "black" will have them blend as only their respective base frame; artifact, colorless, or multicolor; without the color gradient. Setting these as "white" does the reverse, using the gradient alone and not the base cards.

__Bug Fixes__
• Fixed a bug where hybrid Adventure pages were blending incorrectly.
• Fixed a bug where the Set tab Inverted Common Symbol wasn't working on most frames.
