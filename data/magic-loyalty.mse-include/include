### This file doesn't do anything.
### Other files in this directory can be included in game/style files.
### This include covers the loyalty boxes and text stripes on planeswalkers.
### To use it in a template, add the following line, indented by one tab, in the init script section:
#	include file: /magic-loyalty.mse-include/face_loyalty_init_script

### add the following line, not indented, in the styling field section:
# include file: /magic-loyalty.mse-include/face_loyalty_styling_field

### add the following line, not indented, in the card style section:
# include file: /magic-loyalty.mse-include/face_loyalty_card_style

### Also add the following in the template headers:
#depends on:
#	package:			magic-loyalty.mse-include
#	version:			2024-01-29

### Optionally, you can adjust appearance by defining the following functions in the init script:

### To change which face of the card the boxes go on:
# loyalty_face := { 1 }

### To change which card field the boxes snap to,
### 1 is for card.text, 2 for card.text_2, and 3 for card.text_3
# loyalty_text_field := { 1 }

### To move the starting loyalty up/down:
# loyalty_offset_top := { 0 }

### To move the starting loyalty left/right:
# loyalty_offset_left := { 0 }

### To change the starting loyalty size:
# loyalty_offset_width := { 0 }
# loyalty_offset_height := { 0 }

### Similarly for loyalty costs of abilities:
# loyalty_cost_offset_top := { 0 }
# loyalty_cost_offset_left := { 0 }
# loyalty_cost_offset_width := { 0 }
# loyalty_cost_offset_height := { 0 }

### To increase or decrease by how much the text becomes indented when a loyalty cost is active:
# loyalty_cost_offset_text_margin := { 0 }

### To change where the stripes separating the abilities appear on the face:
### This must return the path of a mask with the same dimensions as the face the boxes go on.
### It must have white pixels where the stripes are visible, and black where they are not visible
# loyalty_textbox_mask :=
# {
# 	if is_stamped()
# 	then "/magic-loyalty.mse-include/default_textbox_stamp_mask.png"
# 	else "/magic-loyalty.mse-include/default_textbox_mask.png"
# }
